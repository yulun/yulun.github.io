I am a postdoctoral researcher at Computer Vision Lab, ETH Zürich, Switzerland. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, USA, in Aug. 2021. Before that I received my master degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, China, in Jul. 2017 and B.E degree from School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, China, in Jul. 2013.

My research interest broadly includes machine learning and computer vision. Specifically, I focus on image/video restoration (e.g., super-resolution, denoising, deblurring), synthesis (e.g., style transfer, texture transfer), biomedical image enhancement and analysis, deep model compression (e.g., network pruning, quantization), computational imaging (e.g., spectral compressive imaging), etc. I am/was an Area Chair for CVPR'(2023-2024), ICCV'2023, ECCV'2024, NeurIPS'2023, ICLR'2024, ICML'2024, ACM MM'2024, IJCAI'2024 and Senior Program Committee (SPC) member for IJCAI'(2021-2023), AAAI'(2023-2024).
