I am serving as an Area Chair for <strong>ACM MM 2024</strong> and  <strong>IJCAI 2024 </strong>. We have also released several works: <a href="https://github.com/zhengchen1999/PromptSR" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PromptSR</a> (text prompt in image super-resolution), <a href="https://github.com/ZHITENGLI/BiDRN" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BiDRN</a> (binarization in 3D whole-body human mesh recovery), <a href="https://github.com/caojiezhang/DeqIR" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DeqIR</a> (parallel sampling in diffusion-based image restoration), and <a href="https://github.com/ChunmingHe/Reti-Diff" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Reti-Diff</a> (Retinex-based latent DM and Transformer for illumination degradation image restoration).
